Many students face a silent barrier when it comes to exams—the fear of using computers. **Computer phobia** can lead to poor performance in the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) exams, which are now largely conducted via **Computer-Based Testing (CBT)**. This fear can cause anxiety, mistakes, and even exam failure.

**The Problem:**
For students unfamiliar with computers, navigating the CBT interface, managing time, and responding to questions digitally can be overwhelming. Even strong students in traditional exams may underperform simply because of **nervousness around technology**.

**How Maiduguri Capital School Helps:**

1. **Early Exposure to Computers:**
   From an early age, students interact with computers in a controlled, supportive environment, building comfort and confidence.
2. **CBT Mock Exams:**
   The school regularly conducts **mock JAMB CBT exams**, allowing students to practice under real exam conditions. This reduces anxiety and familiarizes them with the format, timing, and navigation of digital tests.
3. **Guided Training:**
   Teachers provide step-by-step guidance on computer use, ensuring students can handle multiple-choice interfaces, scroll through questions efficiently, and manage their time effectively.
4. **Building Confidence:**
   Repeated practice, feedback, and support help students overcome fear, replacing nervousness with confidence. By the time they sit for the actual JAMB exam, the computer is no longer a source of stress but a familiar tool.
5. **Holistic Exam Preparation:**
   Alongside CBT practice, Maiduguri Capital School emphasizes subject mastery, problem-solving, and critical thinking, ensuring students are prepared both academically and technically.


Computer phobia is a major reason why some students fail JAMB, but it doesn’t have to be. **Maiduguri Capital School equips its students with the skills, confidence, and exposure they need to excel in CBT exams**, turning a potential barrier into a stepping stone for success.
